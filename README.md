Developed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a customized version of the Indigo Template

A windows issue prevents me from testing locally, so everything gets pushed here - sorry for the stupid amounts of commits. Might nuke this and reup someday.

Supports seo-tag & opengraph, Travis-ci, and minification.
