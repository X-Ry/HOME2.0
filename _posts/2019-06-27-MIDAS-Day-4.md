We visited an autonomous car driving facility, Mcity, which was really interesting. They explained to us how they use the facility, creating a real place with all sorts of real road situations, all piled up into one place for optimal testing. They also explained to us how they give the car virtual obstacles to manage with while driving in the real world. It's also the home of the second largest Michigan "M" on campus!

And we learned more about text mining and how that works earlier today.

I'm actually currently packing things and washing clothes! Need to have these things ready for tommorow. We have a morning class and then an afternoon trip to the Big House (Michigan Stadium).
