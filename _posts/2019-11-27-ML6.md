**Polynomial Linear Regression**

This one is similar to Multiple Linear Regression, but it uses exponents 

y =  b<sub>0 </sub>+ b<sub>1</sub>*x<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>2</sub>*x<sub>2</sub>+... b<sub>n</sub>*x<sub>n</sub>

Polynomial Regression:

y =  b<sub>0 </sub>+ b<sub>1</sub>*x<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>2</sub>*x<sub>2<sup>2</sup></sub> +...  b<sub>n</sub>*x<sub>n<sup>n</sup></sub> 

By using exponents, it can solve a bit more of the non-random cases, for example

It’s still called “Linear” Regression because the word linear is referring to the coefficients, not the predictor variables. The coefficients are still linear for now.

Here is the regressor applied to the Leaf Dataset:

Using a much more appropriate dataset that follows the assumptions with the same code:

Trying wacky data and seeing how it reacts:
