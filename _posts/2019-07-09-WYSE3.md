First thing today was doing woodworking and building parts for our 3D Printer in the workshop!

 We got to try many different methods of lifting and lowering the platform the 3D Printed material would rest on, such as using string to lift, using meshed gears to lift, or (our favorite, the one we chose) using a vertical screw to lift and lower wood. It seemed both simple to put together and also the most sturdy and efficient (I have experience from Robotics that putting two gears together is much harder to get consistent than it looks.)

Lots of work went into building the structure. We used many tools to construct our platform and lifter.

First, we are learning about Arduino systems and how wiring using copper tape and soldering works. I'm familiar with a lot of this, so I had the opportunity to try applying R-G-B LEDs and changing how lights light up using Ardunio code. Oh yeah also it's a cute oragami penguin!

Later that day, we began using the LEDs we put together yesterday and have them light up with specific patterns, based on the code input to Arduino.

It turns out that the modified C/C++ used in Arduinos functions very similarly to Java, so I was able to apply that knowledge and turned my penguin's eyes into strobe lights.

However, while building the penguin, I directed my attention towards a LCD screen, and wanted to figure out how to wire that up to an Arduino. I used a sepearte Arduino and Breadboard, and after some tinkering with arduino libraries, I got the LCD to display some static text. Then, I programmed a small language inside the Arduino's looping code to have it scroll the text (it's actually just adding a gradually decreasing amount of invisible spaces).

Later that afternoon, we got the opportunity to finish the CAD designs we began yesterday. I finished the keychain, and 




 built LCD and LED display, etc
?
no more writing?
Did you learn anything new
Or was that the same as northeastern
yes, learned different Arduino langauge and ardunio tools. It's a different tool from before
Ok
no Teensy working with the Arduino, just Breadboard
and LCD
thats what I did in particular after others finished the LEDs
also improved CAD skills
So it's easy?
the online openCAD is made for beginners, fewer tools, but this one has more accesibilty 
Ok
but a lot harder to get used to, this is 2nd day of using it and they are 3d printing things overnight for us
the 3d printer stuff was pretty much just using woodworking tools today, not a lot learned there, more figuring out ourselves how to cut and change pieces
similar to robotics but with woodworking as well
ok
will be back later tonight
