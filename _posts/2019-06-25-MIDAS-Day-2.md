today got a ton deeper, now we basically coded our own AI by the end of today

we also got homework today


so

![sittin students](https://x-ry.github.io/assets/images/MIDAS/sit.gif)

the code path is laid out in front of us

but we are still understanding what we are writing as we go

so most of the stuff we get but some of the tihngs we are doing are either meant to be learned later or we will figure out as we code

![computer predicting leafs from spreadsheet](https://x-ry.github.io/assets/images/MIDAS/2019-06-25.png)

so for example i still dont get what the computer is running to predict things

but i understand lots of things and moving parts surrounding it

either way it does seem to be doing the thing it should be doing, which is good


also the VR is very very cool

We used the Oculus device

we got a few pictures in vr

VR stuff is pure spectacle and makes 3d data visualization easier, not much else to say about it.

the instructor met the VR guy like two days ago and got us access to this tools

"If you can build data visualization in VR"

"How cool is that"

yeah that is what we did today

oh like my own data visualization

yes

the AI stuff though, after the very slow data collecting of the 1st day, i am glad pace has picked up very fast today

"Is tough?"

so we are really getting into deep stuff, i like it
