Today, we finished coding our own AI by the end of today that could compare and contrast leaves!

The code path is laid out in front of us, but we are still understanding what we write as we go, and how each part exactly fits together.

For example, I'm still figuring out whata the computer is running to predict things, but I understand lots of things and moving parts surrounding it. Either way, it's working!

We also went to the Visualization Center, and used an Oculus to analyze data in VR, finding 3d patterns in data.

Our instructor actually met the VR guys like two days ago and got us access to these tools. How cool is that?
