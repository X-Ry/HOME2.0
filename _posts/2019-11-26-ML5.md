**Multiple linear regression Intuition**

Multiple linear regression depends on multiple independent variables, multiplied by coefficients

y =  b<sub>0 </sub>+ b<sub>1</sub>*x<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>2</sub>*x<sub>2</sub>+...  b<sub>n</sub>*x<sub>n</sub>


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Assumptions</strong> <strong>of a Linear Regression</strong> (for it to work good):
   </td>
   <td>What it means:
   </td>
   <td>So does my leaf dataset fit this?
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Linearity
   </td>
   <td>There must be a <span style="text-decoration:underline;">linear relationship</span> between the outcome variable and the independent variables.
   </td>
   <td>Yeah pretty much
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Homoscedasticity
   </td>
   <td>Random disturbance in the relationship are consistent
   </td>
   <td>Not exactly, since the dataset is composed of 8 types of different leaf data, that creates non-randomness. But for each individual group though, the answer is pretty much yes. 
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Multivariate normality 
   </td>
   <td>Multiple regression assumes that the residuals (ypoint - yline) are normally distributed.
   </td>
   <td>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Independence of errors 
   </td>
   <td>Error must be random. The graph on the right has non-random error, while the graph on the left has random error.

**Dummy variables**

Profit - dependent variable

<span style="text-decoration:underline;">State column</span> becomes dummy variables. 

**DUMMY VARIABLE:**

NY   | 	CA

1	0		

0	1		

0	1		

1	0		

0	1		

y =  b<sub>0 </sub>+ b<sub>1</sub>*x<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>2</sub>*x<sub>2</sub>+...     +   b<sub>4</sub>*D<sub>1</sub>

Where b<sub>0</sub>= a coefficient

Where b1 = r&d spent, b2 = admin, b3 = marketing, b4 = NY column, but don’t include CA column? This seems kinda sus, no info was lost but still doesn’t this value NY above CA or something

**DUMMY VARIABLE TRAP:**

y =  b<sub>0 </sub>+ b<sub>1</sub>*x<sub>1</sub> + b<sub>2</sub>*x<sub>2</sub>+...     +   b<sub>4</sub>*D<sub>1  </sub>+   b<sub>5</sub>*D<sub>2</sub>

This is duplicating a variable, and can’t distinguish the different variables. 

D<sub>2</sub> = 1 - D<sub>1</sub>   creates an issue, it’s the same information...

This applies to any amount of dummy variables;

If you have 9 dummy variables, only put 8 in the equation

If you have 2, only include 1, etc.

**P value** - probability that the null hypothesis is correct

**Building a Model**

We don’t need to use every variable, some are unnecessary, add confusion to the data/results



1. Throwing in all your variables

2. Stepwise Regression

    1. **Backwards Elimination (the fastest method out of these)**

			1. Start with a significance level

			2. Throw in all the variables

			3. Remove the predictor variables with the highest P value above the 


            significance level


        4. Refit Model, and remove predictors again


        5. Done.



    2. **Forward Selection**

            1. Start with a significance level


            2. Fit all simple regression models into the model, and select the one with the lowest P value and fit this variable into the model and keep going until none are below the significance level


            3. Done.

    3. **Bidirectional Elimination**

            1.  Start with significance levels, one to stay and one to enter the model


            2.  Perform <span style="text-decoration:underline;">forward selection</span>.


            3.  Perform all steps of the <span style="text-decoration:underline;">backwards elimination</span>, loop back to #2 until no new variables can enter and no old variables can exit the model


            4. Done.

3. Score Comparison (All Possible Models)

        1. Try straight up all 2^n-1 total combinations and choose the one with the best criterion of goodness, which needs to be preset.


        2. Done.
