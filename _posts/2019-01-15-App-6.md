I got in touch with StuCo and finally got access to a new updated club information spreadsheet for 2018-2019!

We'll definitely be replacing the old 2017 sheet we've been using with this.

We worked on:

- formatting the new .json club file & putting it in GutHub/Netlify 

- adding some search function/sorting method for organizing the list of clubs.

- the schedule builder & the button that will check if you are able to participate in a club. 

(I'm actually even wondering if it's possible to make a way for people to import their own Google Calendar and use that to check for availability.)
