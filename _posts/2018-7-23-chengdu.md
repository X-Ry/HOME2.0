At my freshman Summer, I attended Fenghua Academy’s Youth Leadership Development Program. Feng Hua academy is a non-profit educational organization founded in 2004. I went to Chengdu with 15 other high school students from the US and Canada, and we spent 2 weeks living on campus, volunteering in San Yuan Foreign Language School, teaching younger Chinese students English and organizing culture exchange activities. The Culture Exchange Summer Program for local high school students has provided great opportunities for international culture enrichment, volunteering, and leadership development.

In classes, each one of us taught Chinese students the American culture topics we had prepared, and helped organized many team building activities. Before the trip, I spent days selecting topics, preparing materials and practicing class presentations with my teammates. This was my first teaching experience. I’ve learned to adapt to different cultures and have gained leadership skills, but most importantly, I really cherish the friendships I established with students from Chengdu. Today, we are citizens of a global community. I enjoy being a student ambassador who helps building bridges and bringing people together.
