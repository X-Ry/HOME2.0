hello!
little busy
finishing the hw they gave us
today was not as interesting as yesterday but learned just as much
the VR set a pretty high bar

today we went learned about other aspets of data science like the importance of recall, and went more into the computer being able to take in data point and guess categories with machine learning
also had presenter talk about music, i asked them about data science project. They talked about both the importance of not only the finding and analyzing of patterns (particularly in music this is hard and requires a lot of human and robot work together) and also how the gathering of data as a project itself is an often overlooked important part
like for example, Bach music has been analyzed a lot with AI, there is datasets, but things like recent pop. songs require building programs to take in the song and output some form of data that can then be run through AI
he was a cool guy but also made us all sing during the lecture which was awkward haha
i did not get so many pictures today, unfortunately
