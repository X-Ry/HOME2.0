Today we went learned about other aspets of data science like the importance of recall, and went more into the computer being able to take in data point and guess categories with machine learning.

We also heard from a presenter on music and data science, how patterns in music work together. I asked them about my data science project. They talked about both the importance of not only the finding and analyzing of patterns (particularly in music this is hard and requires a lot of human and robot work together) and also how the gathering of data as a project itself is an often overlooked important part.

For example, Bach music has been analyzed a lot with AI, so there are lots of datasets. But things like recent pop songs require building programs to take in the song and output some form of data that can then be run through AI.
