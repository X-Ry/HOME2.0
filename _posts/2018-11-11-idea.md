This is a list of ideas and thoughts, projects that I'd love to undertake if I have all the time in the world. But at least, I believe these original thoughts deserve a place to park, therefore, I will record them in here.

My high school require each student do a 4 year plan or 6 year plan before register couserse for next semester. School provides a booklet explain what each course for. But often, student realize that they did not see the best course they could take in certain semester that would best prepare them for apply college or grow in certain carrir path. Digitize 4 year plan, 6 year plan. Make an app mapping high school courses to respective carrier path would be very helpful.
