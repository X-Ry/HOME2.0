This is a list of ideas and thoughts, projects that I'd love to undertake if I have all the time in the world. But at least, I believe these original thoughts deserve a place to park, therefore, I will record them in here. 

Most recent entries appear at the top.

***
My high school require each student do a 4 year plan or 6 year plan before register couserse for next semester. 
School provides student a booklet explain what each course for. 
But often, students didn't know which course could best prepare them for applying college. Digitize 4 year plan, 6 year plan. Make an app that can mapping high school courses to respective carrier path would be very helpful.
