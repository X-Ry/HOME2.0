Today was the final day to complete our Stereolitographic 3D Printers. 
In the morning, I finished up the Arduino programming, and got the LED Display to mark percent completion for our printer.

Since it was the final day, we were allowed to head down to Green St and get lunch there.

In the afternoon, we learned about the ways fluids interact and are structured, and simulated that using bubbles.

When we think of bubbles created with bubble blowers or rings, we think of them as flat, 2D. However, if we use a 3D bubble blower, it's more efficient for the bubble to be formed by a 3 dimensional shape at the center of the bubble blower, so it creates tetrahedron and icosohedron shaped bubbles. Kinda like our Liquid 3D printers, except working from the outside in instead of top to bottom!

Towards the end of the day, we got more time to complete our Stereolitographic 3D printers. We hooked it up to the computer and projector, so slides that appear on the screen woudl be projected into our printer, which would create the 3d image.

For our final day of class, we took a group photo together.
