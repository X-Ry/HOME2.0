This is a list of ideas and thoughts. Not all of them are serious, though many are. There is no theme, no standard or format. Some may contain sketches, images, diagrams, but most will be text. Some will be personal, others, intensely analytical or removed. Most are based on things I have read, seen, witnessed, or heard -- i like to imagine these represent original thought, but that feels increasingly rare. Many of these could be their own articles but I'm either underqualified to write about it or it's not quite meaty enough.

Most recent entries appear at the top.

We've already collectively begun to realize just how harmful it is as an institution, and the year that Facebook looses users for the first time it its existence is a momentous one.

What replaces it, or, perhaps, how social media adapts to these realizations will change how the internet functions as a social platform entirely.
