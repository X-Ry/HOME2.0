Reminder that App Inventor Club will have photos tomorrow 6th period, come to Gold House at the beginning of the period!

Our next meeting will be 2/19. Maybe you guys already saw, but I started sending out info to club leaders and teachers for corrections, and I'm also going to talk to Ms. Davis about other Info we don't have yet that can be put into the app. At the next meet, we'll have the new spreadsheet, and get working on building the better layout for displaying club information that we designed last time.

If you guys have time before the meet, I couldn't find anything on overlapping text over images, so if anyone can find out how to have Text appear above images transparently, that would be cool.
