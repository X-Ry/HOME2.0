I am hoping to begin a Museum Data Science/Analysis project surrounding how K-12 Students are using museums. I'm beginning to gather ideas and proposals, and want to get in talks with museum data analysts at the MSI, Art Institute of Chicago, Field Museum, Adler Planetarium, Chicago History Museum, Museum of Contemporary Art, Peggy Nature Museum, and Children's Museum at Navy Pier and see if I can use formal data analysis methods (R language) to display this data graphically, identify any patterns or trends across data, potentially build a tool, like a website or app, to connect students and help them learn about oportunities that museums provide, provide analysis to museum to help improve exhibition quality and attract more youth visits, and maybe even create a database that can connect museum content with what students are learning in class. 
It's a pretty ambitious project right now, and I'm likely going to focus down on a few or maybe just one museum, and hopefully reach some of those potential outcomes. Below are some of my plans for the project.
