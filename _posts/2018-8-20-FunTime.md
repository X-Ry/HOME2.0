I enjoy goofing off and engaging in aimless recreation after a long day of school. I especially enjoy making videos. Here are a few clips. 

Start with one I created when I was in elementary school: 

[What Tau Sounds Like to the 100th note](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne8hEfVqK0o&t=55s)

[Math Team Video 1: Raiders Of The Lost Math Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTvGtnOyJqI&t=1s)


[Trap in the Phone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYrDnpfR-Kg&t=3s)


[But Oxygen's Heavier than Helium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31TuHZr8tRQ)

[Towelporter: English Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dM7nsPcvjU)









<span class="drop-cap">YSP</span> The Young Scholars Program (YSP) at the University of Chicago offers enthusiastic and talented math students from seventh through twelfth grades an opportunity to strengthen their mathematical powers through a deep experience in mathematical thought and effort. The intention of the program is to broaden and enrich students' understanding of mathematics. Last year's key topics are in number theory. At the end of the summer camp. I made a T-shirt to reflect what we've learned at YSP. Here is a link to the video. YSP-T-shirt Design Explained.
