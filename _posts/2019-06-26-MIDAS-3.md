super yes
today got a ton deeper
now we basically coded our own AI by the end of today
we also got homework today


so
the code path is laid out in front of us
but we are still understanding what we are writing as we go
so most of the stuff we get but some of the tihngs we are doing are either meant to be learned later or we will figure out as we code

![computer predicting leafs from spreadsheet](https://x-ry.github.io/assets/images/MIDAS/2019-06-25.png)

so for example i still dont get what the computer is running to predict things
but i understand lots of things and moving parts inside of it 
surrounding it
either way it does seem to be doing the thing it should be doing     which is good
with custom data
anyways


also the VR is very very cool
We used the Oculus device
we got a few pictures in vr

VR stuff is pure spectacle and makes 3d data visualization easier, not much else to say about it.
the instructor met the VR guy like two days ago and got us access to this tools

"If you can build data visualization in VR"
"How cool is that"

yeah that is what we did today
oh like my own data visualization
yes

the AI stuff though, after the very slow data collecting of the 1st day, i am glad pace has picked up very fast today
"Is tough?"
so we are really getting into deep stuff
i like it
