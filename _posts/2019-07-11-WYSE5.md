This morning, we continued work on our 3D Printers. We managed to use a special Motor Chip to get our Stepper Motor not only running left and right, but also changing speed, based on button inputs form a sepearte breadboard.

Today was also the day Code Gang and Build Gang got together to try and connect our motor code to the physical 3D lifter.

After that, I began testing what amount of rotations were required to move the 3D Printer 2/3 mm down and 1/3 mm up on a loop, which is what the 3D Printer required to work properly. I use the green tape (shown in next picture) to determine distance for 10 360 rotations, and found that for every 10 rotations it moves 7 mm, and applied that knowledge to the code.

We moved onto our next activity for the day, which was Making our own Carbon Ink Flames.
