**Why Machine Learning is the Future**

We are making exponentially more data over time

2005 - 130 Exabytes of data on earth ever

(Exabyte = A Billion Megabytes)

2020 - 40900 Exabytes of data on earth ever

We use a fraction of this data

Machines can use a bigger fraction

With Machine learning, we can start to process, understand, and use data!!

**Installing Python and Anaconda (Mac, Linux & Windows)**

They use Python 3.5. I use Python 3.7

still need to figure out how to use Object Inspector?? But to be honest it’s not too important
