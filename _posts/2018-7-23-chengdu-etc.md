Fun Fact!

The Chinese education system is divided into six years of primary school, and three to six years of secondary education, often followed by several years of higher education.
The students we taught in Chengdu were elementary school students in China, but the Americna equivalent of that would be 6th grade; middle schoolers.

Chinese Elementary Schoolers (小学生 xiao xue sheng) attend Elementary School (小学 xiao xue).

Chinese Middle Schoolers (中学生 zhong xue sheng) attend Middle School (初中 chu zhong).

Chinese High Schoolers (高中生 gao zhong sheng) attend High School (高中 gao zhong).
