This is mostly a placeholder post until I actually write a proper article about this experience, but I'm going to be teaching myself [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3) over the next few months, and am going to be sharing my exercises/creating tutorials from which you can learn too!

The short and sweet: D3 is a javascript-based datavis library for crunching datasets and turning them into interactive html and svg charts. It is used extensively by sites like FiveThirtyEight, along with ggplot and R (those are next on my list) for making the interactives they host. It is pretty cool, but has a really steep learning curve -- which is what I'm going to try to conquer by creating my own lessons for it. There aren't any really good *linear* tutorials out there (more just tutorials for certain elements, like "let's make a pie chart"), so I figured I'd attempt to fill that gap.

Normally with JS libraries, the approach is to just learn the basic premise then rely on the API to finish your project, but D3 demands a more complete understanding -- it makes you learn how to *think* in D3. At least, that's what I'm going for here.

You can follow along by watching/starring [this repo](https://github.com/justinwzig/learning-d3), or waiting until I'm "done," at which point I'll post here :).
