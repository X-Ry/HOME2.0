Hey there! I'm Justin Ziegelmueller, a high school senior from Chicago currently attending [Northside College Prep,](http://www.northsideprep.org/), but I hope to study some combination of computer science, interactive media, business, economics, and/or politics in college. Most of my time is spent either studying or making, designing, and developing all manner of things. I mostly reside in my basement, but if I'm not there, you're liable to find me out for a sail on Lake Michigan or skiing on a hill somewhere.

Around school, I dedicate a *ton* of time to extracurricular activities, including Policy Debate (in fact, I'm typing this during a long (very bumpy) bus ride to a tournament this weekend), Vote16 Illinois, Illinois High School Democrats, NCP Student Council, Stage Crew, NCP Makerspace, NCP Code, Chicago Student Union, and a few others for which I develop websites. The Northside community has provided me with unprecedented opportunity to explore my interests and hang out with some really amazing -- and intensely bright -- students. 

This past year, I've been really focusing on growing Vote16 Illinois, a political initiative to lower the Voting age to 16 in the state of Illinois that I founded and have helped to grow. We've seen a large increase in membership and support from across the state and city, which has been amazing -- we've ventured into civic education and are, in addition to our legislative efforts, seeing real change at a local level. I lead the communications team and help organize political outreach for Vote16.

Much of my commitment to Vote16 is derived from my love of politics and economics, and a more specific interest in youth political engagement and activism. Political science fascinates me, and while I'm not exactly considering it as a career, I hope that I have a chance to incorporate politics into whatever I wind up doing.

I have also been dedicating quite a bit of time to the NCP Makerspace, a student-led studio at Northside working to make technologies like 3D printing and laser cutting to the Northside student body. This year, we opened the makerspace and are working towards integrating it into the curriculum and community. It's a ton of fun to work with the machines (we have 4 3D printers, a Carvey CNC machine from Inventables, and a laser cutter is on its way) and I'm really looking forwards to teaching about making.

I was also recently accepted as a fellow for the Jesse Garfinkel for State Representative campaign, and have been helping to administrate their communications efforts and build their website. This goes hand in hand with my web design work for various clubs at NCP and external clients.

My interests in computer science aren't so much focused around raw code as they are product design, project management, and broad strokes development; I can find my way around a project directory just fine, but I much prefer mocking up interfaces or developing a plan to implement a product. Otherwise, I'm a huge fan of data analysis and IoT.

As far as the more practical side of things goes, I love making. This includes computer-aided fabrication (I own and operate a [Printrbot 3D printer](https://printrbot.com/shop/assembled-simple-metal-with-heated-bed/)), simple woodworking, electronics, and, if you'll accept the loose definition of making, photography and cinematography. I don't frequently buy parts, opting instead to tear apart whatever I can get my hands on or I find in the alley and seeing where I end up. I'm also handy when it comes to computer hardware.
